    <li>According to the Polymorphism principle, methods in different classes that do similar things should have the same name.</li>
    <li>Polymorphism means many types or many forms. Simple example of polymorphism are
        <ul>
            <li>we are turn on the phone by one button at the same time we can turn off the phone by the same button.</li>
            <li>Similarly we can turn on the vehicle with the one key and with the same key we can turn off the vehicle.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>We use interface / Abstract classes to implement polymorhpism concept.</li>
    <li>In general terms the word 'polymorphism' means ‘a state of having many shapes’ or ‘the capacity to take on different forms’. But in object-oriented programming, it is the ability to process objects of various types and classes through a single, uniform interface.</li>
    <li>As we explained before, polymorphism is the process of creating several objects from specific base classes. </li>
    <li>Objects could be of any type. A discrete class can have discrete properties and methods which work separately to other objects. However a set of objects could be derived from a parent object and retain some properties of the parent class. This process is called polymorphism. An object could be morphed into several other objects retaining some of its behaviour.</li>
