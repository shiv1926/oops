<h2>Abtraction</h2>
<ul>
    <li>There are several situations where we want that a class and their direct child classes must have some functions, there functionaliy may be different for each class. so we just define that functions. </li>
    <li>Abstraction is the process of hinding unwated details and show only essential information to the users. there are several real life examples of abstraction, some of them mentioned below.
        <ul>
            <li>Your car is a great example of abstraction. You can start a car by turning the key or pressing the start button. You donâ€™t need to know how the engine is getting started, what all components your car has. The car internal implementation and complex logic is completely hidden from the user.</li>
            <li>When we are making a call it only concatenate about the numbers and display that in screen,we really do not know how this connect with other number.</li>
            <li>We send data from Bluetooth we really do not know how it connect with other phone or devices.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>In OOPS Abstraction is done by classes or interface.</li>
    <li><strong>ABSTRACT METHOD</strong> is a method that has just the method definition but does not contain implementation. A method without a body is known as an Abstract Method. We have to use 'ABSTRACT' keyword in method signature.</li>
    <li>Any class that contains at least one abstract method is known as abstract class.</li>
    <li>Abstract method and abstract class can not be declared as final, becuase abtract means, it has to be extended, and final means it can't be extend.</li>
    <li>An abstract class can have normal method also, with private, protected and public access modifiers.</li>
    <li>It is not allowed to create an instance of a class that has been defined as abstract.</li>
    <li>When we inheriting from an abstract class, all abstract method in the parent's class must be defined by the child. these methods must be defined with the same (or a less restricted ) visibility. For example, if the abstract method is defined as protected, the function implementation must be defined as either protected or public, but not private.</li>
</ul>
