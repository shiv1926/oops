Design Patterns: First invented by the "Gang of Four", design patterns are just tricks in object oriented programming to solve similar sets of problems with a smarter approach. Using design patterns (DP) can increase the performance of your whole application with minimal code written by developers. Sometimes it is not possible to design optimized solutions without using DP. But unnecessary and unplanned use of DP can also degrade the performance of your application. We have a chapter devoted for design patterns in this book. 
Subclass:A very common term in OOP, and we use this term throughout this book. When an object is derived from another object, the derived one is called the subclass of which it is derived from.
