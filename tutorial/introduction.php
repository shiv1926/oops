<p>Our world is full with the example of object oriented concepts.</p>
<h2>What is  object oriented programming : </h2>
<p>Object-oriented programming â€“ As the name suggests uses objects in programming. Object-oriented programming aims to implement real-world entities like inheritance, hiding, polymorphism, etc in programming. The main aim of OOP is to bind together the data and the functions that operate on them so that no other part of the code can access this data except that function.</p>
<p>A type of programming in which programmers define not only the data type of a data structure, but also the types of operations (functions) that can be applied to the data structure. In this way, the data structure becomes an object that includes both data and functions. In addition, programmers can create relationships between one object and another. For example, objects can inherit characteristics from other objects.</p>
<p>One of the principal advantages of object-oriented programming techniques over procedural programming techniques is that they enable programmers to create modules that do not need to be changed when a new type of object is added. A programmer can simply create a new object that inherits many of its featuresfrom existing objects. This makes object-oriented programs easier to modify.</p>
<p>reusability and extendability are the two main </p>
<p>Procedural programming is about writing procedures or functions that perform operations on the data, while object-oriented programming is about creating objects that contain both data and functions.</p>
<p>Object-oriented programming has several advantages over procedural programming:</p>
<ul>
<li>OOP is faster and easier to execute.</li>
<li>OOP provides a clear structure for the programs</li>
<li>OOP helps to keep the PHP code DRY "Don't Repeat Yourself", and makes the code easier to maintain, modify and debug</li>
<li>OOP makes it possible to create full reusable applications with less code and shorter development time</li>
</ul>
<p>Tip: The "Don't Repeat Yourself" (DRY) principle is about reducing the repetition of code. You should extract out the codes that are common for the application, and place them at a single place and reuse them instead of repeating it.</p>
